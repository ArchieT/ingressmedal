ingressmedal
============

AP and medals counting for Ingress (games from Niantic Labs (a Google company))

Usage
---------

***The code is now partly functional***

It can print you the amount of AP you gained from different actions. Percents coming soon.

Currently you have to enter the numbers manually. I'm going to implement OCR in the future.

Program currently works only in text-only mode.

Why
---------

 * I'm learning Python
 * I love Ingress
