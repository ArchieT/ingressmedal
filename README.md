ingressmedal
============

AP and medals counting for Ingress (game from Niantic Labs (a Google company))

Usage
---------

***The code is now partly functional***

It can print you the amount of AP you gained from different actions. Percents coming soon.

Currently you have to enter the numbers manually. I'm going to implement OCR in the future.

Program currently works only in text-only mode.

Why
---------

 * I'm learning Python
 * I love Ingress
 * I want to give something to the humanity. It may become useful for someone who hadn't found out better tools yet and/or prefers the text-only mode.
