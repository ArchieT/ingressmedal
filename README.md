ingressmedal
============

AP and medals counting for Ingress (game from Niantic Labs (a Google company))

Usage
---------

####The code is now functional, but the whole project is still at a somehow early stage of development

 * It can print you the amount of AP you gained from different actions and their percentage of total AP.
 * It can save your entry to XML.
 * It can read your data from XML and tell you your average number of [attribute] per week between entries.

Currently you have to enter the numbers manually. I'm going to implement OCR in the future.

Program currently works only in text-only mode.

###Search GMail for mails:
 * **edits**: *"Ingress Portal Data Edit Accepted:"*
 * **photos**: *"Ingress Portal Photo Accepted:"*
 
###What are the 'Uncomputables"?

The uncomputables are those values or parts of values, which can't be calculated. They are listed in the "AP-whereitcomesfrom-mindmap.mm" FreeMind mindmap in the info/ directory.

Why
---------

 * I'm learning Python
 * I love Ingress
 * I want to give something to the humanity. It may become useful for someone who hadn't found out better tools yet and/or prefers the text-only mode.
